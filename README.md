# Performance Task - Explore
## Technology Problems

Society has often struggled with how to incorporate new technology ethically and responsibly. Considerable thought and study is necessary to understand the potential cultural impacts of innovation. In this performance task, you will explore one side of an current argument about how to best use an emerging technology to better people's lives, while a partner explores the other side of the argument. Your close examination of this problem will deepen your understanding of the possibilities and limits of computer science.

You will be provided 8 hours of class time to develop, complete, and submit the following:
	
* A Computational Artifact
* Written responses

## General Requirements

This performance task requires you to select and investigate one of the following problems. You will flip a coin to decide which partner takes responsiblity for defending each position.

* **Information Privacy and Security**<br>
	Encryption has become an integral part of the technology we use in our everyday lives. It essential for the protection of important and personal information such as photos, financial data, even our travel habits. However, the need for privacy must be balanced by the government's responsibility to investigate and prevent crime and terrorism.

	*Pro*<br>
	Encryption should be designed to be as unbreakable as possible.<br>
	<br>
	*Con*<br>
	Encryption needs a governmental "back door" to ensure public safety.

* **Patents**<br>
	The patent system allows start-up innovators to get their products to market without worrying about being overwhelmed by more well-funded companies using their ideas. It has also lead to the rise of "patent trolls", companies with the sole purpose of acquiring patents and using the legal system to profit on existing products.

	*Pro*<br>
	The patent system is fundamentally broken, and I have a solution.<br>
	<br>
	*Con*<br>
	The patent system is working as intended, or needs some small adjustments.

* **Information Journalism**<br>
	Journalism has drastically changed in the internet era, especially since the opening of anonymous leaking sites such as Wikileaks. The public now has access to an enormous amount of private information that never in history has been widely available. There are several serious criticisms of this journalistic approach however. The information and its sources are rarely verified for authenticity, and dubious and perhaps illegal methods are used to obtain it.

	*Pro*<br>
	Anonymous leaks provide a check on corruption. The more information available the better.<br>
	<br>
	*Con*<br>
	Anonymous leaks are easily manipulated by bad actors. The information is unreliable and not in the public's best interest.

* **Automation**<br>
	From taxi driving to manufacturing, technology has been replacing a standard workforce in many industries. While providing much more convenience for users and increased efficiency, the threat to jobs and the economy has been raised by people concerned for our future.

	*Pro*<br>
	Automation is worthwhile overall for society.<br>
	<br>
	*Con*<br>
	Too much automation will hurt our economic future.

## Submission Requirements

1. **Computational Artifact**<br>
	Your computational artifact must provide an illustration, representation, or explanation of the problem's history, situation, or societal effect. The computational artifact must not simply repeat the information supplied in the written responses and should be primarily nontextual.

	Submit a video, audio, or PDF file. Use computing tools and techniques to create one original computational artifact (a visualisation, a graphic, a program, or an audio recording). Acceptable file types include .mp3, .mp4, .wmv, .avi, .move, .wav, .aif, or.pdf format. PDFs must not exceed three pages. Video or audio files must not exceed 1 minute in length or 30MB in size.

2. **Written Responses**<br>
	Submit one PDF file in which you respond directly to each of the prompts below. **Clearly label your responses 2a-2e in order**. Your responses must provide evidence of the extensive knowledge you have developed about your chosen problem and its impact(s). Write your responses so they would be understandable to someone who is not familiar with the problem. Include citations, as applicable, within your written responses. **Your response to prompts 2a-2d combined must not exceed 700 words**. The referenced required in 2e are not included in the final word count.

	#### Computational Artifact
	2a. Provide inforamtion on your problem and computational artifact
		* Describe the problem and why it exists
		* Describe how your computational artifact illustrates, represents, or explains the problem's history, situation, or societal impact.
		(Approx. 100 words)
	2b. Describe your development process, explicitly identifying the computing tools and techniques you used to create your artifact. Your description must be detailed enough so that a person unfamiliar with those tools and techniques will understand your process.
		(Approx. 100 words)

	#### Technology Problem
	2c. Explain both sides of the argument. Describe at least one benefit and harmful effect for each side. Give equal weight and effort to both sides.
		(Approx. 250 words)
	2d. Using specific details, make a recommendation for a solution to the problem. Your solution may draw from either the pro or con arguments, meet somewhere in between, or offer a third way forward as long as it is a defensible (and defensed) position.
		(Approx. 250 words)
	#### References
	2e. Provide a list of at least three online or print sources used to create your computational artifact and/or support your responses to the prompts provided in this performance task.

	* At least two of the sources must have been created after the end of the previous academic year.
	* At least 2 sources must be available online or in print. The third may be online, in print, or a personal interview with an expert in the field.
	* Each source must be relevant, credible, and easily accessed.
